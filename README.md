# Living La Vida Dystopia

## A new era of technology is here; here, we combine the wonders of AR (Augmented Reality) while enjoying reading an exciting book written by the poet Enrique Jimenez IV.  

## From the moment you grab this book, you can scan selected images to enjoy the immersion of AR. Picture this for one second: You hold the book, you start reading, and when you scan a specific portion of the book, words and images come to life. It almost seems impossible, but it is possible thanks to today's advances.
